Textabl
================================================
### A quick, fast way to throw events together.

This was something hacked together for CerealHack's 2012 summer hackathon in Sacramento, for which it was awarded 3rd place.

## The problem

Imagine you want to grab a movie with a dozen or so friends after work. I mean, come on. It's a Wednesday, work's been
intense, and you just want to unwind. However, all your friends are scattered around. Half of them are on facebook, half of
them aren't, and they all keep firing movie ideas back via texts to each other. By the time you guys figure out what to
do, you've already killed an hour. 

Organizing quick events/hangouts with friends is hard. Facebook events are detailed and thorough, but tend
to be slow-moving and bad for, say, seeing a movie after work.

Text messages are great because they're fast, easy, and awesome, but are awful for organization.

## The solution

Textabl brings these two things together. By creating a facebook event with a group text tied to it, it's easy to organize
events quickly and easily. The facebook event keeps data organized and neat, and the group text keeps people up to 
date with event information and details.
