Textabl
================================================
#### A quick, fast way to throw events together.

This was something hacked together for CerealHack's 2012 summer hackathon in Sacramento, for which it was awarded 3rd place.

Organizing quick events/hangouts with friends is hard. Facebook events are detailed and thorough, but tend
to be slow-moving and bad for, say, seeing a movie after work.

Text messages are great because they're fast, easy, and awesome, but are awful for organization.

## The solution

Textabl brings these two things together. By creating a facebook event with a group text tied to it, it's easy to organize
events quickly and easily. The facebook event keeps data organized and neat, and the group text keeps people up to 
date with event information and details.

## Running the server:

ruby -rubygems hi.rb


## API's used:
* Facebook
* Twillio
